Setting: Break room at the office during the last Wednesday of the month.  

A: Hey, Sarah! What are you planning to do with your free afternoon today?  
B: Hi, Mike! I’m thinking about catching a movie. It’s been ages since I had time to relax. How about you?  

A: That sounds great! I just finished binge-watching a series on Netflix. But today, I’m going to take a stroll at the park. I need some fresh air!  
B: Nice choice! Which series were you watching?  

A: I was watching that new crime drama, "The Silent Witness." It’s really intense! You should check it out if you like thrillers.  
B: I love thrillers! I’ll add it to my watchlist. What’s your plan for the park?  

A: Just walking around, maybe grabbing a coffee. I’ll probably bring my headphones and listen to some music.  
B: Sounds relaxing! I might do that next time. I really just want to chill on my couch today.  

A: Totally understand! Sometimes you just need a day to do nothing.  
B: Exactly! Plus, it’s nice to have some time for ourselves, you know?  

A: For sure! So, are you going to the movies alone or inviting anyone?  
B: I’m thinking of going solo. It’s kind of nice to enjoy a movie by yourself sometimes.  

A: That’s true! A little “me time” is important. Well, enjoy the movie! Let me know how it is!  
B: Thanks, Mike! Have a great time at the park!  

A: You too! Catch you later!  
B: Bye!
